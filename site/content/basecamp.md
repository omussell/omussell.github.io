## Shape Up

- Shaped versus unshaped work
- Setting appetites instead of estimates
- Designing at the right level of abstraction
- Concepting with breadboards and fat marker sketches
- Making bets with a capped downside (the circuit breaker) and honouring them with uninterrupted time
- Chooing the right cycle length (six weeks)
- A cool-down period between cycles
- Breaking projects apart into scopes
- Downhill versus uphill work and communicating about unknowns
- Scope hammering to separate must-haves from nice-to-haves

## Getting Real
