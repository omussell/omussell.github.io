## Quick Multi-Node Kubernetes Cluster

### Multipass

=> https://multipass.run/ Multipass
lets you easily spin up Ubuntu VMs on a workstation.

```
# Install
snap install multipass --classic
```

Then to create a new instance, just run `multipass launch`. It will create a new instance based on an Ubuntu LTS image.

To access the instance, just run `multipass shell $name`. You then have full access to the instance.

The instances can also be bootstrapped via 
=> https://cloud-init.io/ cloud-init
in the same way that instances on cloud providers are.

### Microk8s

=> https://microk8s.io Microk8s
is a small Kubernetes distribution designed for appliances.

```
# Install
sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.16/stable
sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER
su - $USER
```

### Cluster

So with two Multipass instances launched, and Microk8s installed on each, we can now join them together to 
=> https://microk8s.io/docs/clustering form a cluster
 by running `microk8s.add-node` on the proposed master and then the requisite `microk8s.join` command on the other node.
